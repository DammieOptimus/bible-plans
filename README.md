## üìñ About The Project

This project contains two aesthetically pleasing, single-file HTML applications designed to guide users through the Bible. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and intuitive interface that makes daily scripture reading a joy.

Each app is fully responsive and saves your progress in the browser's local storage, so you can pick up where you left off on any device.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Two Distinct Apps:**
    *   **New Testament in a Month:** A 30-day plan to read the entire New Testament.
    *   **Old Testament in Two Months:** A 60-day plan to journey through the Old Testament.
*   **Flexible Reading Plans:** Both apps offer two ways to read:
    *   **Canonical Order:** The traditional order of the books.
    *   **Chronological Order:** Read the events as they happened in time.
*   **Interactive Progress Tracking:** Simply check off each day's reading to mark it as complete. Completed days are visually distinct, giving you a clear sense of accomplishment.
*   **Persistent State:** Your progress is automatically saved using the browser's Local Storage. No login or database required.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** A beautiful and usable interface on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Self-Contained:** Each app is a single `.html` file. No build process or dependencies needed. Simply open the file in a browser.
